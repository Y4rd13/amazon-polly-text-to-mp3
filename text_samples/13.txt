 Prokaryotes lack a membrane-bound nucleus. Instead, prokaryotic DNA is located in the
nucleoid region of the cytoplasm and is attached to the plasma membrane. The DNA is a
single, circular molecule in a complex with protein. The nucleosomes and histone proteins
associated with eukaryotic chromosomes are absent. Prokaryotic DNA is also distinguished

by the presence of smaller, extrachromosomal rings of
DNA called plasmids, which replicate separately and can
be transferred from cell to cell.
