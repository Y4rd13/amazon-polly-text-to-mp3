Some prokaryotes produce a glycocalyx (sugar coat) of carbohydrate or protein on the outer
surface of their cell walls. This glycocalyx can be a thick capsule that protects pathogenic spe-
cies from the hostâ€™s defenses as well as from some antibiotics. The glycocalyx can also form a
slime layer that enables cells to adhere to a substrate or to one another during the formation
of bacterial assemblages (biofilms).
