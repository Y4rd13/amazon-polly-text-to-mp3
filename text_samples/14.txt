 Prokaryotes do not undergo mitosis and lack mitotic
apparatus. Instead, they reproduce by binary fission.
Once the circular DNA molecule is duplicated, the cell
membrane elongates, causing the two attached DNA cop-
ies to pull apart. Then the cell wall and cell membrane
pinch inward and divide the cell into two halves, each of
which becomes a daughter cell. Binary fission is a form of asexual reproduction that results
in daughter cells that, in the absence of mutation or the other processes described below, are
copies of each other and of the parent cell.
