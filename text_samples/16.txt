 Although bacterial reproduction is asexual, genetic variability arises through mutation. Once
a mutation appears, it can be passed among individuals of the same or of different species by
horizontal gene transfer. Horizontal gene transfer can occur by conjugation. This process
occurs when two bacteria of different mating strains exchange DNA via cellular extensions
called sex pili. Bacteria may also take up DNA from fragments left by dead bacteria in the
external environment, a process called transformation. Finally, bacterial viruses called bac-
teriophages (or phages) can transfer DNA as they infect new cells, a process called transduc-
tion. Because of the rapidity of bacterial reproduction, novel genetic traits, such as antibiotic
resistance, can spread rapidly within and between species.
