 The plasma membrane of prokaryotes is composed of a semipermeable phospholipid bilayer
with integral and peripheral proteins. Glycolipids and cholesterol are absent, although a
diverse array of fatty acids allows for the regulation of membrane fluidity. Although true
membrane-bound organelles are absent in prokaryotes, the plasma membrane may form
intracellular extensions in some photosynthetic and nitrifying bacteria, allowing for addi-
tional surface area for membrane-associated enzymes.
