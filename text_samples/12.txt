 Free ribosomes in the cytosol coordinate protein synthesis. The ribosomes of bacteria
and Archaea differ from each other and from eukaryotic ribosomes in size and nucleotide
sequence. Because of this, antibiotics such as tetracycline can specifically target bacterial
RNA without affecting human host cells. Bacterial cells are now known to contain cytoskel-
etal elements homologous to the microfilaments, microtubules, and intermediate filaments
of eukaryotic cells.
