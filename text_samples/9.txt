 Fimbriae are thin protein filaments that extend from a prokaryotic cell to aid their attach-
ment to other cells or to the substrate. Fimbriae are used by some species of pathogenic
bacteria to attach themselves to their host. Sex pili are similar to fimbriae but are longer
extensions used to attach two cells together for the process of conjugation. This process is
described in “Genetic Variation in Prokaryotes.”
