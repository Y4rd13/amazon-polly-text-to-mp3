 Prokaryotic cells consist of a cell wall, a plasma membrane, cytosol, a nucleoid region, ribo-
somes, and a cytoskeleton, as shown in Figure 3.29. Prokaryotic cells are much smaller than
eukaryotic cells. All metabolism occurs in the cytosol. Because of their small size, prokaryotic
cells can rely on diffusion and lack the complex membrane-bound organelles of eukaryotes.
