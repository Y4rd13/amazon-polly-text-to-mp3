 One of the most medically important mutations in bacteria is the development of antibiotic
resistance. Genes that confer resistance to antibiotics are frequently transposons, mobile
genetic elements that can move from place to place in the genome. Transposons in bacteria
frequently jump between the bacterial chromosome and plasmid DNA. Plasmids, in turn,
can be transferred between bacteria of the same or even different species, contributing to the
spread of antibiotic resistance or other associated genes through horizontal gene transfer.
