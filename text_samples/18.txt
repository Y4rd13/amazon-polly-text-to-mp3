 The spread of antibiotic resistance in bacteria is further promoted through natural selec-
tion. When an antibiotic is applied, most of the bacteria are destroyed. However, a few may
carry genes that give them some degree of resistance to the antibiotic. Those few quickly
multiply, particularly if the antibiotic is stopped prematurely, resulting in a new population
against which the antibiotic is no longer effective. This process of natural selection can lead
to widespread antibiotic resistance in environments in which antibiotics are in heavy or con-
tinuous use. In addition, horizontal gene transfer can cause resistance to spread even among
unrelated species of bacteria.
