 Prokaryotes include two highly divergent lineages of single-celled organisms: the domains
Eubacteria and Archaea. The Eubacteria include familiar bacteria such as Escherichia coli,
Streptococcus, Staphylococcus, and other medically important species. The Eubacteria also
include the free-living, photosynthetic cyanobacteria such as blue-green
algae. The Archaea have only recently been identified as entirely distinct
from bacteria based on differences in DNA sequence, biomolecular struc-
ture, and enzyme pathways. Archaean prokaryotes have been found in
extreme habitats such as deep-sea vents and hot springs. Methane-produc-
ing species are found in the digestive tract of humans and ruminants.
