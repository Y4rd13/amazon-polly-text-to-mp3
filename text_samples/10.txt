 Some types of prokaryotes have one or more flagella on their outer surface to allow move-
ment. Prokaryotic flagella are smaller than eukaryotic flagella and differ in structure. A bacte-
rial flagellum consists of a whiplike filament of the protein flagellin embedded in the cell wall
and plasma membrane. The filament is attached to a basal apparatus, or ion-driven motor,
by a hooklike swivel. This swivel rotates the flagellum in a corkscrew motion.The energy to
move the flagellum is provided by a proton gradient, or proton motive force. This proton
gradient is produced when hydrogen ions are actively transported across the flagellar mem-
brane. The flow of ions back into the cell through ion channels provides the energy needed to
rotate the flagella in either direction.The motion of the bacterium may be random, or it may
be toward or away from a chemical signal (positive chemotaxis and negative chemotaxis,
respectively).
