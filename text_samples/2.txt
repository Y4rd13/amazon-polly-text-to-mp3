 All prokaryotes are unicellular, occurring as single cells or in colonies.
Prokaryotes exhibit a variety of shapes and are described as either coccus
(spherical), bacillus (rod shaped), or spirillus (spiral). They may be further
classified based on whether they occur singly, as pairs (diplo-), in straight chains (strepto-), or
as branching clusters (staphylo-). Figure 3.28 shows the shapes of several types of prokaryotes.
