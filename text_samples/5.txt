 Gram-positive bacteria have a thick layer of peptidoglycan on the outer surface of the cell
wall. This thick layer causes the cell to retain crystal violet dye and stain purple when sub-
jected to a procedure known as a Gram’s stain. Gram-negative bacteria have only a thin layer
of peptidoglycan located in a fluid-filled region called the periplasm, sandwiched between
the inner (plasma) membrane and an outer membrane of lipopolysaccharide and channel
proteins. Gram-negative bacteria do not retain crystal violet dye from a Gram’s stain and
appear pink or red due to the underlying safranin stain.
