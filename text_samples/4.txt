 The cell walls of bacteria and archaea are distinct from the cell walls of plants and fungi,
which contain cellulose or chitin. Most bacterial cell walls are composed of peptidoglycan,
a polysaccharide cross-linked with short amino acid chains. Based on the characteristics of
their cell wall, bacteria are classified as either gram-positive or gram-negative.
